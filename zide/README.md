# `zide`: A Zellij IDE-like Layout Environment

Zide is a combination of [Zellij](https://zellij.dev) layouts and convenience `bash` scripts that creates an IDE-like layout environment. It mainly consists of a file picker (such as `yazi`) in one pane, and your editor of choice in the main pane. You can browse the file tree in your picker pane, and then any files that are selected or opened do so in the editor's pane.

The project was inspired by the [`yazelix`](https://github.com/luccahuguet/yazelix) project, but simplifies it down to work in most shells (instead of requiring `nushell`), more editors (vs just Helix), and essentailly any file picker, with less required configuration.

## Features

1. Start a `zellij` layout with a filepicker on the left and your editor on the right
1. Browse for files in any visual file picker of your choosing, and open any selected files or directories in your editor pane
1. Open multiple files at once in your editor if your picker supports a multiselect UI
1. When opening a directory, set that directory as the working directory in your editor automatically 
1. Automatic resizing for `yazi` and `lf` to change the number of columns based on the width of the picker pane

This project has been tested and works well with the following modal editors:
- [Helix (`hx`)](https://helix-editor.com)
- [Kakoune (`kak`)](https://kakoune.org)
- [NeoVim (`nvim`)](https://neovim.io)
- [Vim (`vim`)](https://www.vim.org)

And the following file pickers:
- [`yazi`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)
- [`nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn)
- [`broot`](https://dystroy.org/broot/)
- [`lf`](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
- [`fff`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff)
- [`felix`](https://github.com/kyoheiu/felix)

But will probably work with just about any TUI file manager.

## Why?

I recently started using [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) as my editor of choice. I loved most everything about it, except that there was no tree-style file browser to open files. While the fuzzy finder is fantastic for quickly getting to files I know about, I often work in large monorepos where I don't know the directory or file naming structure in advance, and a visual filepicker is extremely useful. On top of that, [`yazi`](https://yazi-rs.github.io) is an incredibly powerful and useful tool for file management, and integrating it seemlessly with Helix was high on my list of priorities.

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/josephschmitt/zide/releases/latest) or clone the project files and place them somewhere convenient on your system (such as `$HOME/.config/zide`).

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:josephschmitt/zide.git $HOME/.config/zide
```

Then add the `bin/` directory to your `PATH`.
```sh
# Add this to your shell profile
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/zide/bin"
```

### Dependencies

This project integrates [`zellij`](https://zellij.dev) with a file picker of your choosing and an editor, and so you'll need these installed for any of this to work (if no specific file picker is set, it defaults to [`yazi`](https://yazi-rs.github.io)).

There are some additional (optional) layouts included that use a [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) floating pane for easy git integration, so you'll need `lazygit` installed if you plan on using that. Otherwise, the rest is written in plain `bash` so it should work on a wide variety of systems without further dependencies.

## Usage

```sh
  $ zide [OPTIONS] <working_dir> <layout>
```

Run the `zide` command to start using Zellij with the zide-style IDE-like layout. It accepts two positional arguments, both of which are optional:

1. `<working_dir>` Defaults to `.`, aka your current working directory. Whatever directory you pass as this argument will be the directory that the file picker, your editor, and any future panes will start out in. If you want to open the IDE to a specific project, I suggest passing in that project's directory as this argument (as opposed to navigating after startup) so the working directory is correctly set.
1. `<layout>` Defaults to the `ZIDE_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` env var if set, otherwise to `default`. You can see the list of available layouts in the [`layouts/`](./layouts) directory.

When executed, the `zide` command will do one of two things:

1. If you're not currently in a `zellij` session, it'll start one
1. If you're in an existing `zellij` session, it'll create a new tab

### Options

1. `-p, --picker`: File picker to use. Available file pickers are listed in `bin/lib`. This is equivalent to setting `ZIDE_FILE_PICKER` env var.
1. `-n, --name`: Optional name to give the newly opened session (when starting a new session) or tab (when launching from an existing session). If a session with this name already exists, it'll use a default random session name.
1. `-N`: Name the newly opened session or tab after the directory being opened (ignored if `--name` is set). If a session with this name already exists, it'll use a default random session name.

### Available Layouts

The following layouts can all be found in the [`layouts/`](./layouts) directory as separate .kdl files. You can choose which layout to start with by either passing it to the `zide` command, or setting the `ZIDE_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` env var.

### `default`

By default starting `zide` will use a layout consisting of 2 vertical split of panes with a filepicker on the left occupying a small slice of it, and your editor on the right occupying the rest, with your current working directory set as the directory in both your editor and the filepicker.

If you add one more pane, you'll have the choice between two swap layouts: "compact" and "wide". The "compact" layout will set the new pane below the editor, while the "wide" layout will set it to the right. Adding a 4th pane will split these panes in half, vertically for "compact", and horizontally for "wide".

#### `tall`

The `tall` layout takes advantage of tall screens or windows and lays the panes out horizontally, with the picker occupying the top of the layout in a narrow view, and the editor below. Due to zide's new-found config switching, if you use `yazi` or `lf` as your file picker, this layout will automatically switch to a 3-pane view.

</p>

#### `stacked`

The `stacked` layout uses Zellij's pane stacking feature to create 3 horizontal panes stacked on top of each other, but only 1 pane is visible at any one time. Switching panes will then make that pane visible, and collapse the rest.
<p align="center">

</p>

---

Each default layout also includes a `_lazygit` variant that includes a floating pane running `lazygit` for easier git access.

</p>

 Any additional layouts you add or configure in the zide `layouts/` directory will be available to use from the `zide` command, and will be git ignored.

## Configuration

```sh
$ zide --help
```

For basic help, you can use the `-h` or `--help` flags on any of the available commands to get details on how to configure them.

### Custom Layouts

If you want to make your own layouts, duplicate any of the built-in layouts in the `layouts/` directory and give them custom names. You'll be able to refer to those names when providing a custom layout to the `zide` command.

You can make any type of layout you like and use any and all of Zellij's awesome layout features. The one absolute requirement is that **your editor pane must be next to the picker pane**. There's no way to uniquely identify the different panes in `zellij` (outside of a plugin, anyway), therefore these scripts depend on calling `zellij action focus-next-pane` to focus your editor from your picker.

### Environment Variables

This project provides customization via the use of environment variables:

1. `ZIDE_DEFAULT_LAYOUT`: Default layout. Available layouts can be found in the zide `layouts/` directory. Feel free to add some layouts of your own here (they're gitignore'd).
1. `ZIDE_LAYOUT_DIR`: Optionally point to a different directory that contains your layouts. Defaults to the `layouts/` directory in this project.
1. `ZIDE_FILE_PICKER`: The file picker command to use, defaults to `yazi` if none is set.
1. `ZIDE_ALWAYS_NAME`: When set to `true`, it'll always use the basename of the current working directory as the name of a new Zellij zide session or tab. Equivalent to always using the `-N` flag.
1. `ZIDE_USE_YAZI_CONFIG` (defaults to `true`): When using `yazi` as a file picker, this will point it to the `yazi/yazi.toml` included with this project instead of using the default config. This config comes with the `auto-layout.yazi` plugin that will automatically set the number of columns based on the available width. If you want to continue using your standard `yazi` config, you have two options:
   1. Use your global `yazi` config by setting this env var to `false`
   1. Use a custom config just with zide by pointing this env var to a custom config directory. If you have a custom file at `my/custom-config/yazi/yazi.toml`, then you would set `ZIDE_USE_YAZI_CONFIG=my/custom-config/yazi`.
1. `ZIDE_USE_LF_CONFIG` (defaults to `true`): Same idea as `ZIDE_USE_YAZI_CONFIG`, but for `lf` as the picker. Much like the custom `yazi` config, this config includes logic to automatically change the number of columns based on the available width. If you want to customize this config, you have the same two options as `yazi` above:
   1. Use your global `lf` config by setting this env var to `false`.
   1. Use a custom config just with zide by pointing this env var to a custom config directory. Note that the directory here should be the directory the `lf` config lives inside of, not the `lf` directory itself. So if you have a file at `my/custom-config/lf/lfrc` with your config, then you should set `ZIDE_USE_LF_CONFIG=my/custom-config`.

### File Picker Configurations

#### [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)

If you're using `yazi` and want to use a custom config other than your default and the one included in this project, you can point to a custom config directory in the `ZIDE_USE_YAZI_CONFIG` var.

```toml
# ~/.config/yazi-custom/yazi.toml

[manager]
ratio = [0, 1, 0]
show-hidden = true
# Some more config options here
```

```sh
export ZIDE_USE_YAZI_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/yazi-custom"
```

This will use that config when running in zide, but not when running `yazi` normally. If you want to retain the auto-layout logic, you'll have to add the [`yazi/plugins/auto-layout.yazi`](./yazi/plugins/auto-layout.yazi) plugin to your config's `plugins/` directory, and then add `require("auto-layout")` to your `init.lua`.

```lua
-- ~/.config/yazi-custom/init.lua
require("auto-layout")
````

#### [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)

If you're using `lf` and want to use a custom config other than your default and the one included in this project, you can point to a custom config directory in the `ZIDE_USE_LF_CONFIG` var.

```env
# ~/.config/custom-configs/lf/lfrc
set hidden true
# Some more config options here
```

```sh
export ZIDE_USE_LF_CONFIG="~/.config/custom-configs"
```

To retain the auto-layout logic, you'll need to integrate with the `on-redraw` cmd like we do in the custom config by adding this to your `lfrc`:

```env
cmd on-redraw %{{
    if [ $lf_width -le 40 ]; then
        lf -remote "send $id set ratios 1"
    elif [ $lf_width -le 80 ]; then
        lf -remote "send $id set ratios 1:1"
    else
        lf -remote "send $id set ratios 1:1:2"
    fi
}}
```

## How it works

This project consists of 4 parts:

1. Pre-configured `zellij` layouts
1. The `zide` command to launch you into zide mode
1. A wrapper script around launching file pickers called `zide-pick`
1. A wrapper script that controls opening files in your editor called `zide-edit`

### `zide`

The main `zide` command controls opening new `zide` tabs, either in an existing session if inside one or starting a new one. It sets some environment variables, updates the working directory, and starts `zellij`.

### `zide-pick`

The `zide-pick` command is a small wrapper around the file pickers. It handles launching the correct picker based on either the `--picker` flag or the `ZIDE_FILE_PICKER` environment variable. This lets us avoid having to hard-code what picker to use in our layouts.

It also has one more very important job, which is changing the `EDITOR` env var to be `zide-edit` instead of your actual editor, so that the pickers open up our script instead of the real editor when picking files.

### `zide-edit`

The `zide-edit` command takes the place of your `EDITOR`. Instead of launching your `EDITOR`, it automates switching to your open editor pane, and sends it the correct `zellij` action commands so that it opens those files in the open editor pane.

### `zide-rename`

The `zide-rename` command is a convenience script for renaming zellij tabs. You can provide it a parameter of a tab name, and it'll use that to rename the currently focused tab. However, its main use case is in a layout as an auto-closing pane. Usage in this way will automatically name new tabs after whatever directory they're being opened to.

---

Conceptually, this is the basic flow of the system.

We start up `zellij` with our layout (say two panes, left is `yazi` via our `zide-pick` wrapper script, and right is our editor, `hx`). When you choose files in `yazi`, `yazi` will attempt to open those files in `EDITOR`, which now points to `zide-edit`. The `zide-edit` script then switches the focused pane using `zellij action focus-next-pane` (which hopefully is the pane with your editor). It then writes the following commands to the pane to execute in the editor:

1. `zellij action write 27`: This sends the `<ESC>` key, to force us into Normal mode in your editor.
1. `zellij action write-chars :open file1.txt subdir/file2.txt`: This essentially just sends the `:open file1.txt subdir/file2.txt` command to your editor, which will tell it to open those files.
1. `zellij action write-chars :cd subdir/`: **If you chose a directory** in your filepicker it'll also send the `cd` command to set the working directory to that directory in your editor.
1. `zellij action write 13`: Send the `<ENTER>` key to submit the commands.
