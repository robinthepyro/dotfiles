### robinthepyro's Hyprland Dotfiles

These are the important parts of my configuration.
It's a somewhat unique Hyprland setup with emphasis
on being minimal but having things that bring me joy.

Currently I use this on Arch Linux, I don't know what the
availability of the packages is like on other distros.

# USE THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
These configs work, on my machines. I haven't tried
most of these configs anywhere else.

There is a high likelyhood of hardcoded nonsense so
be prepared to tweak stuff untill it works. The only
reason this repo is public is because someone asked,
and signing into github on every university PC I want
to move my helix config onto is really annoying.

I would say spare your sanity and just write your own
dotfiles, but hey. Maybe these are useful to you.
